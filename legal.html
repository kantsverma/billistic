We will collect any Personally Identifiable Information that you provide when you register for Billistic and that you choose to enter through the Service (including in comments or other content that you submit to us). This will include information that we can use to contact or identify you as an individual, such as your name, email address, and zip code (“Personally Identifiable Information”).For third party websites that you wish to access and manage through our Service (your “Accounts”), we also will collect the passwords and user names that you provide to us. We will only use this information in order to access those third party websites on your behalf for purposes of providing the Service.

						</li>
						<li>How we use cookies and other technologies. Billistic uses various technologies to store information on your computer and / or mobile device and to provide you with content, including cookies and web beacons. Cookies are text files we place in your computer's and / or mobile device’s browser. These will be used to store your preferences, to personalize your experience at the Site, and to save your password. If you want to use the Service, you must leave cookies enabled. The Service will not work without them. Billistic does not act on Do Not Track requests from your browser. Doing so allows Billistic to personalize your experience on our site and to have access to content we think you will find relevant. Web beacons are electronic files that allow us and our advertisers to count users or to access certain cookies to enable the delivery of information tailored to your interests. Billistic (or third party services providers on our behalf) may also use cookies and other technologies to collect aggregate information about web site users on an anonymous basis (“Anonymous Information”). We may share Anonymous Information with our prospective and actual business partners, Shared Registration Sites, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose including, without limitation, to serve you ads (see section 6 below). Some of our third party partners (including advertisers, Shared Registration Sites and marketing services companies) may set and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer as well, or we may do so on their behalf. We do not have control over how these third parties use such cookies and similar technologies or the information derived therefrom. Our Web site also includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button [and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site]. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. </li>
						<li>We protect the information we collect.  We take the privacy of your personal information very seriously. We use firewall barriers, TSL 256-bit encryption techniques and authentication procedures, and other technical measures to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Billistic accounts and systems from unauthorized access. To learn more about our security practices see security@billistic.com. We strive to use the highest commercially acceptable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, but no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure at all times. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personally Identifiable Information. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personally Identifiable Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we will seek to notify you as promptly as possible in the circumstances, by email or other means where we deem in our discretion that such notification is appropriate. Billistic also has designed a security program to protect the security of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of that information, and protect against unauthorized access to such information that could result in harm to our customers. Under the Billistic security program, only Billistic employees whose job functions require access to customer information will have access to your Personally Identifiable Information, and even in those cases they will only be authorized to use it for the purposes that are required to provide the Service and otherwise comply with our Terms of Use. All Billistic employees undergo financial and criminal background checks as a condition of employment. Your personal data and documents are encrypted and stored in a facility protected by 24 x 7 security and biometric controls. We don’t store your personal information in logs or other unsecured repositories, and we don’t search or extract data from your documents.</li>
						<li>Third-party advertisements and websites.  In addition to ads and content that we serve you directly, we use third-party advertising companies and marketing services companies to serve ads and other content when you visit Billistic and elsewhere on the internet and in other media. In the course of doing so, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser by such companies. In addition, we and these companies may use Web beacons to help manage our online advertising and content.

Our primary objective is to provide a secure environment for our customers to manage their online accounts. Billistic employs leading-edge technologies, standards, and business practices to protect your personal information.</p>
					<ol>
					  <li>
						<i>Here are some key features of our security technology:</i>
						<ul>
							<li>We have deployed a dedicated environment in a highly secure data center, supported by resilient network architecture.</li>
							<li>We employ state-of-the-art encryption technology both when transmitting and when storing your data.</li>
							<li>Firewalls and security monitoring appliances are deployed throughout our networks for end-to-end protection of our environment.</li>
							<li>We use a sophisticated toolset, based on industry best practices and methodologies, that alerts us to possible threats before they can affect you.</li>
							<li>We test and certify all our applications and systems for effective security controls.</li>
							<li>We are subject to frequent internal and external assessments and audits as part of our continued efforts to improve our security posture.</li>
						</ul>
					  </li>
					  <li><i>Here are more details on how we keep you and your information safe:</i>
						<ul>
							<li>All your personal information is transmitted securely using Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology with the highest encryption algorithm available today. These same algorithms are utilized by all of the top U.S. financial institutions. To further protect your information, we use encrypted session cookies, which are common computer tools, to help you easily use the site. You know you are protected when your browser address bar turns green.</li>
							<li>We have enlisted the services of three industry leaders to verify our security. Symantec is our security certificate provider and its trusted “Norton Secured” security seal is displayed on our site. TRUSTe has certified our privacy policy and privacy practices. Tinfoil Security scans our site daily to ensure there are no known vulnerabilities present.</li>
							<li>Your Billistic login is secured using a one-way 256-bit salted hash, the same security FDIC insured banks are required to use.</li>
							<li>Your documents are also encrypted, and they reside in our secure storage until you choose to delete them.</li>
							<li>We don’t transact with your money on the Billistic website – we are a “read-only” service. No one can manipulate any of the information in your accounts from within the Billistic Service. When you are ready to pay a bill, you are redirected to that account’s website to pay the bill.</li>
							<li>All our employees undergo criminal background checks as a condition of employment. Access to systems holding your personal data is strictly limited and constantly monitored.</li>
							<li>All information is stored on dedicated hardware in a secure datacenter which is monitored 24/7 by bonded and licensed security services.</li>
							<li>Physical access to hardware is controlled by multi-level, biometric authentication.</li>
							<li>We have a comprehensive set of information security policies and operating procedures that are based on the International Standards Organization (ISO) 27001 framework, which is used by the top U.S. financial institutions and U.S. Government agencies.</li>
							<li>All employees are required to comply with our policies and participate in regular security training and awareness education.</li>
							<li>We adhere to the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standard, which is the credit card industry standard against which all groups who process or handle credit cards are tested regularly.</li>
							<li>We employ expert security and compliance officers to certify adherence to our policies. Billistic regularly has security industry experts perform simulated attacks and other tests on our systems to ensure the integrity of our security.</li>

				<h1>Web Site Account Best Practices</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>When selecting your “Secret Question” choose answers that are not easily available to someone else.
						<ul><li>Example: If your Secret Question is "What high school did you go to," It is not recommended that you use the high school you attended if it is posted on your Facebook page. Others will be able to obtain this public information and answer your security question. A secure way to do this would be to use a high school you can remember (e.g., a rival high school, the name of your school district, a high school where you wanted to attend, or your current child's high school).</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li><span>Tips for creating a secure password:</span>
						Passwords are the first line of defense to access your billistic account. We recommend you:
						<ul>
							<li>Include special characters [/.!@# ect.. ].</li>
							<li>Numerical characters.</li>
							<li>Mix capital and lowercase letters.</li>
							<li>Include similar looking substitutions, such as the number zero for the letter 'O' or '$' for the letter 'S'.</li>
							<li>Create a unique acronym-based passphrase, such as Everything Is Going To Be Okay becomes “E1GtB0” or the first letter of each word from a verse of a song, such as, “The Stars at night are shining bright,” becomes “Ts@nasb"..</li>

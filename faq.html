			<h3>How does Billistic work?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Billistic simplifies bill management. Simply set up an account and direct your electronic bills (in PDF format) to your billistic.com mailbox. Billistic will import the bills, attach them to your account and notify you when your payments are due. Use account settings to further customize your Billistic experience if desired.</p>
			</div>		
			<h3>How do I get my electronic bills into Billistic?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>When you sign up for Billistic your user ID becomes your Billistic mailbox. Billistic constantly scans you mailbox for bills, which must be in PDF format, and when received,extracts billing data and saves it to your account. Once the extract and account update are complete, the bill is stored electronically with your account and the mail message is deleted. You can forward bills to your billistic.com email box if they support it, you can have your biller send bills directly to Billistic.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Can Billistic handle PDF bills that are encrypted?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Yes. In accounts settings, when you set up a billier such as Verizon or Comcast, you may	also specify that the bill will be encrypted. You would also enter the password needed to decrypt that bill. Note that this password does not and indeed should not be the same password that you’re using for your account with that biller. Most billers do not yet support that feature, but we are encouraging them to support in ASAP.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>What happens to my bill after Billistic extracts the data from the PDF?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Once billing data is extracted from a bill, Billistic saves that bill to your account,recording the month and year received. Depending on the Billistic plan you are signed up for, bills will be stored up to indefinitely and may be reviewed, downloaded or printed at any time.</p>

			</div>
			<h3>Are my bills and the rest of my information in Billistic accessible by anyone other than me?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>No. Billistic encrypts sensitive data before storing in our database. All access to that data is also secured via 256-bit AES encryption, used by the US government and top financial institutions to secure their data. As long as you protect your Billistic password, no unauthorized access to your data will occur.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Does Billistic log into my biller accounts (like Comcast & Verizon)?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>No. Billistic will never log into your personal accounts and will not ask you for user name and password for those accounts. We strive to effectively manage your bills without you having to share that personal information.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Is Billistic free?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Billistic offers several service plans to our subscribers. The base plan is, and will always be free. Other tiers of service are also offered at different price points. These come with additional features. To compare our current service plans click here.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>What is ExplainMyBill?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>ExplainMyBill is a feature offered by Billistic that brings a standard PDF bill to life by adding capabilities. When EMB is available for a bill, when you display that bill on your screen you will notice that areas of the bill have additional content added. This could include video clips, text, pop-up boxes, etc. This content provides specific answers to the most common questions relating to the content your viewing. The intent of EMB is to allow subscribers to get all their questions answered without having to contact the biller and speak with a customer service representative.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Can Billistic pay my bills for me?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Billistic intends to add automated bill-pay to our capabilities later this year. When we do, you’ll be able to pay any or all of your bills with the touch of a single button. Billistic can also be configured to auto-pay bills that are within a certain dollar amount of percentage of the prior month’s bill amount. We will always notify you when this occurs.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Does Billistic show me bill pay history?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Billistic can show you what you’ve paid over a certain date range for one or all</p>
			</div>			
			<h3>Does Billistic have an app for my smartphone and tablet?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Not currently. However the Billistic web site was built as a “responsive design” site. configured billing providers.Responsive design means that the web site optimizes itself based on the device you’re accessing from and even the orientation (landscape or portrait) of the screen. We’re confident that you’ll enjoy your experience on these mobile devices as much as you do on your desktop PC.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Is my info used by anyone other than me?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Billistic provides a unique feature that allows you to compare what you’re paying for a given service (such as mobile phone) to others in your area (zip code) are paying for that same service. While you’re personal information is NEVER shared or sold to anyone, the price that you pay for a specific service may be aggregated along with all others who have that service in your zip code, in order to provide the comparison to other users. Likewise, when you’re doing the compare, your neighbors’ (in your zip code) charges are being aggregated to provide your comparison.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>How soon after a bill is received is it available in my Billistic account?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Our goal is to have that bill added to your account within a few minutes of being received by the system.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Can I send receipts to my Billistic email account and have them verified against my credit card statements?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Great idea! It’s on our roadmap but probably won’t be available until 2015.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Why do you ask for my income? Do you need it?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>No. However, for your convenience, Billistic provides monthly income to expense ratioreceived by the system.information which shows graphically what you spend in relation to what you make. We don’t need your income but we can’t provide these reports without that information.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Can individual bills be allocated to specific people in my household?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Yes. Under account setup for that specific biller, just enter the individual’s name that the bill should be allocated to.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Can Billistic keep track of my total spending for the month?</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Yes. Billistic automatically totals all bills due and paid for the month. It can even divide the costs among various members of the household. So for example, if 3 roommates live together and one pays 40% of all costs and the other two pay 30% each, Billistic can track that to let each roommate know what they owe for the month.</p>
